# Working Memory

This file serves as a running log of actions and thought processes while working on this repository.

## 2025-10-07
- **Action:** Created this `AGENTS.md` file to act as working memory, logging activities and reasoning.
- **Thoughts:** Documenting key decisions and context should help future sessions quickly understand past work.

## 2025-12-01
- **Action:** Cleaned up `index.html` (single title tag, fixed NOAA-20 label, removed duplicate GeoJSON export button, corrected attribution text, and resolved the duplicate `currentImageryLayer` declaration) and adjusted the theme toggle copy.
- **Thoughts:** Main priority was removing the JavaScript parse error that prevented the map from loading; additional tweaks keep the toolbar text consistent. Further polish could include consolidating export controls and validating external API availability.
